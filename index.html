                 <p>I have tried so many recipes and nothing compares to this cinnamon roll recipe! I did have to add more vanilla and some butter but overall
                     the best recipe I have seen.

                <p>I haven't ever tried gyoza but one day I thought I would try it. My friend told me about this recipe. I figured I had to try it.
                    I can't believe I have lived my whole life without trying gyoza. Man was I missing out! definitely recommend!
