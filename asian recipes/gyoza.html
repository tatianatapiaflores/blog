        <h2>Gyoza</h2>
        <p>This is my sister in laws recipe, her gyoza are out of this world! This is a simple recipe but you might need a couple of extra hands. 
            Folding each gyoza takes a while but it is so worth it. </p>

                <li>
                    half an inch of finely minced ginger
                </li>
                <li>
                    a slash of sake 
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 tsp of sesame oil 
                </li>
                <li>

        <div>
            <p>Place the ground pork, sake, sesame oil, and soy sauce in a medium size bowl.

        <div>
            <p>Mix everything together, pull out the wrappers and a little bowl of water. Place 1/2 a tbsp of filling in the wrapper, enough so that the wrappers close. If the wrappers are over 
                stuffed they will pop open when cooking. Wet the wrapper with the water and fold the square wrapper into a triangle.

        <div>
            <p>Once all the wrappers are folded drop some oil into a medium sized pan on medium heat. Put the gyoza in one layer on the pan. 
                Cook for 4 mins, than throw in 1/4 cup of water in the pan and cover for another 4 mins. Repeat until all gyoza are cooked, and crispy.
