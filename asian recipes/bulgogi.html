            <p>First grab a medium size bowl, add equal parts of the water, soy sauce, and sugar. If you increase the amount of meat just make sure 
                those three are equal parts.

        <div>
            <p>Now add in the ginger, garlic, onion, mirin, apple sauce and sesame oil. Add the beef to the bowl, mix around until everything is 
                coated evenly. Cover and put in the fridge for 4 hours or overnight.

        <div>
            <p>Start your sides first because the meat cooks super fast. Grab a medium size saute pan, heating to medium temperature. 
                Throw everything in the bowl in the pan once it is heated. Cook until it is done. </p>
