            <p>Start off my rinsing the potatoes and chopping them into little squares. The smaller the squares the faster they cook. Put potatoes in 
                medium size pot with water covering potatoes, place on stove at medium high heat.

            <p>Once potatoes are done about 30 mins, drain half of the water. Return to stove add all the seasoning, butter, and heavy cream. Start to mash them up,
                 Mash them until you are happy with the consistency, I mash mine until it is mostly smooth but has some chucks in it.</p>
